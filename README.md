This project is a web application developed by me and some colleagues using
C#, HTML, Javascript and SQL which efficiently manages the appointments for
a medical clinic. Users can create a personal account and then they can register
in order to make appointments to a chosen speciality and doctor or to cancel
them. Doctors also can register in their personal accounts. After attending a
certain number of appointments, users receive some points in their accounts
which leads to receiving some discounts.
